# quantum-mechanics-numerov-method
This project implements the Numerov method for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation in the context of quantum mechanics. The Numerov method is a numerical technique commonly used to solve second-order ordinary differential equations, making it applicable for studying wavefunctions in quantum systems.

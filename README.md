# Quantum Mechanics Numerov Method Implementation

## Introduction

This project implements the Numerov method for solving the Schrödinger equation in the context of quantum mechanics. The Numerov method is a numerical technique commonly used to solve second-order ordinary differential equations, making it applicable for studying wavefunctions in quantum systems.

## Features

- **Numerov Method:** Implementation of the Numerov method for solving the Schrödinger equation.
- **Node Counting:** Functionality to determine the number of nodes in a given wavefunction.
- **Well-Behaved Wavefunctions:** Identification of well-behaved wavefunctions based on user-defined tolerances.
- **Energy Search:** Searching for energy values corresponding to well-behaved wavefunctions within a specified range.
